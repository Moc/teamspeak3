# TeamSpeak 3 #

*TeamSpeak 3* is a plugin for e107 v2.x which includes TeamSpeak 3 viewer menus, displaying the status of your TeamSpeak 3 server. In addition, more detailed information about a specific TeamSpeak 3 server can be listed. 

Probably, in the future, more features will be added such as administration functionalities to manage more aspects of your TS3 server. 

**THIS PLUGIN IS NOT OFICIALLY RELEASED YET AND SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TESTING AND DEVELOPMENT AT THIS POINT.**

## Requirements ##
* e107 v2.x (latest)
* PHP 5.3+
* Willingness to read the documentation ;)

**To be clear**: e107 v1.x (or prior) is not supported, nor is any PHP version prior to PHP 5.3! 

If your website is running on anything lower than PHP 5.3.0,  you are over  **FOUR YEARS  behind on schedule!** PHP 5.3.0 was released on the 30th of June 2009, do something!


## Roadmap - planned features ##
* Multiple TS3 viewer menus (ability to add each server to different menu areas)
* Add templates to modify the layout of the viewer
* Administration functionality (under consideration)
